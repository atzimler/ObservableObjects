2.0.0:
- Migrating to .NET Stardard 2.0

1.2.0:
- Adding [DataContract] to the ObservableObject class, so the model structure can be tagged with [DataContract] too. This is only a requirement for the DataContract serializer for defining serialization events.
      
1.1.0:
- Fixing that protected OnPropertyChanged was not virtual and because of this did not allow to hook into the infrastructure.
      
1.0.0:
- Initial NuGet Packaging. Package extracted from ATZ.MVVM library to allow independent reuse.
